- [ ] T034o [P] (Future) Design sky color unlock mechanic tied to boss defeat (Option D element)

**Current Settings**: `fixed_time: 6000` (noon), `effects: minecraft:overworld`, biome `sky_color: 9474192` (grey)

**Note**: 固定時刻の値（4000-8000=明るい時間帯）と空の色はプレイテスト後に調整可能

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

#### T034p: Sky Color Change on Time Tyrant Defeat

**Purpose**: Implement dynamic sky color change when Time Tyrant is defeated, making the sky slightly brighter as the first step of sky color progression.

**Implementation Approach**: Client-side Mixin (similar to FogRendererMixin)

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Create SkyColorMixin class**
   - File: `common/src/main/java/com/chronodawn/mixin/client/SkyColorMixin.java`
   - Target: `net.minecraft.client.renderer.LevelRenderer`
   - Method to hook: `renderSky()` or related sky rendering method
   - Pattern: Similar to FogRendererMixin (biome detection + RenderSystem calls)

2. **Implement boss defeat detection**
   - Check Time Tyrant advancement: `chronodawn:time_tyrant_defeated`
   - Use AdvancementManager on client-side to query completion status
   - Cache result to avoid repeated checks

3. **Apply sky color override**
   - Default color: `0x909090` (144, 144, 144) - current grey
   - After Time Tyrant defeat: `0x5588DD` (85, 136, 221) - bright blue sky
   - Apply color only in Chrono Dawn dimension
   - Direct color replacement (no interpolation needed)

4. **Update Mixin configuration files**
   - Add SkyColorMixin to `chronodawn.mixins.json`
   - Update `chronodawn-fabric.mixins.json` (with refMap)
   - Update `chronodawn-neoforge.mixins.json` (without refMap)

5. **Testing**
   - Test without Time Tyrant defeat (should show grey sky: 0x909090)
   - Test with Time Tyrant defeat (should show bright blue sky: 0x5588DD)
   - Test dimension transition (color should reset when leaving/entering)
   - Test multiplayer sync (all players should see same sky color)

**Technical References**:
- Similar implementation: `FogRendererMixin.java` (lines 28-82)
- Advancement check: Use `ClientAdvancements` or player NBT data
- Research document: See `research.md` section "T034n: DimensionSpecialEffects Research"

**Success Criteria**:
- Sky color remains grey (0x909090) by default
- Sky color becomes bright blue (0x5588DD) after Time Tyrant defeat
- Color change persists across game sessions
- No performance impact on rendering
- Works on both Fabric and NeoForge

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Future Enhancement**: This task is the first step towards full sky color progression (T034o) where defeating all bosses gradually restores the sky to vanilla blue (0x78A5FF).

### Special Blocks - World Generation & Advanced Features (US1)

**Note**: Current implementation allows special blocks (Reversing Time Sandstone, Unstable Fungus) to be obtained only via creative mode or commands. This section defines future tasks for natural generation and gameplay integration.

**Considerations for Reversing Time Sandstone**:
- **Natural Generation**: Should spawn in appropriate terrain (deserts, beaches, structures) rather than plains, as it's sandstone-based
- **Block Variants**: Consider adding stone-based variants (e.g., Reversing Time Stone) for different biomes
- **Special Tool**: Design a special tool (e.g., "Temporal Pickaxe") that can permanently break and collect these blocks before restoration
- **Integration**: Tie into existing structures (Ancient Ruins, Forgotten Library) or new generation features

- [ ] T086a [US1] Design natural generation strategy for special blocks (biome selection, frequency, placement rules)
- [ ] T086b [US1] Consider and design block variants for different terrain types (sandstone for deserts/beaches, stone for caves/mountains)
- [ ] T086c [US1] Design special tool specification for breaking restoration blocks (crafting recipe, mechanics, additional features)
- [ ] T086d [US1] Implement worldgen features and/or structure integration for special block placement

### Decorative Terrain Features (US1 Enhancement)

**Current Implementation**: Boulders (mossy cobblestone), fallen logs (random_patch, 2-3 blocks scattered), gravel disks (radius 2-5 blocks)

**Future Improvements**:
- [ ] T088ai-a [US1] (Future) Implement straight fallen logs using NBT structures for more natural appearance (current: random_patch creates scattered logs)

### Playtest Improvements - Dimension Mechanics

**Purpose**: プレイテストで発見されたディメンション機能の改善

- [x] T301 [P] Fix bed sleeping mechanic in Chrono Dawn (currently sleeping doesn't advance time to morning)
  - **Issue**: Chrono Dawn has day-night cycle but sleeping in bed doesn't skip to morning
  - **Root Cause**: Custom dimensions don't naturally support time skipping when sleeping (Minecraft limitation)
  - **Solution**: Implemented SleepMixin to manually check if all players in Chrono Dawn are sleeping and advance time to morning
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created SleepMixin.java that hooks into ServerLevel.tick()
    - Checks if ALL players in Chrono Dawn dimension are sleeping long enough
    - Advances time to morning (1000 ticks) when all players are sleeping
    - Independent from Overworld sleep mechanics (dimension-specific)
    - Respects Chrono Dawn's variable time cycle system
  - **Files Modified**:
    - common/src/main/java/com/chronodawn/mixin/SleepMixin.java (new)
    - fabric/src/main/resources/chronodawn-fabric.mixins.json
    - neoforge/src/main/resources/chronodawn-neoforge.mixins.json
  - **Tested**: Build successful, all game tests passed (92/92)

### Playtest Improvements - Boss Battle

**Purpose**: プレイテストで発見されたボスバトル関連の改善

- [x] T302 [P] Fix Master Clock boss room door unlock requirement
  - **Issue**: Door opens with only Ancient Clockwork x3, should also require Key to Master Clock
  - **Investigation**: Check BossRoomDoorBlock.java unlock condition logic
  - **Fix**: Update unlock requirement to check for both Ancient Clockwork x3 AND Key to Master Clock
  - **Completed**: Modified BlockEventHandler.java:166 to require both hasRequiredAncientGears() AND hasKeyToMasterClock()
  - **File**: common/src/main/java/com/chronodawn/events/BlockEventHandler.java:166
- [ ] T303 [P] Prevent non-boss mob spawning in Desert Clock Tower boss room
  - **Issue**: Other mobs spawn in Desert Clock Tower boss room during battle
  - **Investigation**: Check structure configuration and spawning rules for desert_clock_tower
  - **Possible solutions**: Add no_mob_spawning flag to boss room area, or implement custom spawning blocker
- [ ] T303a [P] Prevent Master Clock structure from being overwritten by other structures
  - **Issue**: Master Clock may be overwritten by other structures (e.g., Ancient Ruins, Desert Clock Tower)
  - **Investigation**: Check structure generation priority and placement rules
  - **Possible solutions**:
    - Adjust structure generation priority (step parameter in structure_set)
    - Add structure spacing/separation rules to prevent overlap
    - Implement custom structure conflict detection system
    - Use higher `step` value (e.g., RAW_GENERATION) to ensure Master Clock generates before other structures
- [x] T304 [P] Fix Master Clock boss room ceiling height for Time Tyrant
  - **Issue**: Time Tyrant cannot pass through some low-height areas in Master Clock boss room
  - **Solution**: Increased ceiling height in problematic areas to accommodate Time Tyrant (height = 3.5 blocks)
  - **Files Modified**: common/src/main/resources/data/chronodawn/structures/master_clock_boss_room.nbt
  - **Commit**: 035a723 (fix: improve Master Clock boss room layout for better gameplay)
- [x] T305 [P] Prevent player camping in Master Clock boss room
  - **Issue**: Players can hide in safe spots and attack Time Tyrant without risk
  - **Solution**: Removed hiding spots from room layout to ensure boss has proper access to entire arena
  - **Files Modified**: common/src/main/resources/data/chronodawn/structures/master_clock_boss_room.nbt
  - **Commit**: 035a723 (fix: improve Master Clock boss room layout for better gameplay)

### Playtest Improvements - Exploration

**Purpose**: プレイテストで発見された探索関連の改善

- [ ] T306 [P] Add Ancient Ruins location assistance system

  - **Investigation**: Check Ancient Ruins spawn frequency and distribution
  - **Possible solutions**:
    - Add craftable compass that points to nearest Ancient Ruins
    - Increase structure spawn rate in chronodawn_plains/forest
    - Add visual cues (e.g., beacon beam visible from distance)
    - Add advancement hint system with approximate coordinates

## Notes

- [P]タスク = 異なるファイル、依存関係なし
- [Story]ラベルはタスクを特定のUser Storyにマッピング (トレーサビリティ確保)
- 各User Storyは独立して完了・テスト可能であるべき
- 実装前にテストがFAILすることを確認
- 各タスクまたは論理的なグループ後にコミット
- 任意のCheckpointで停止してストーリーを独立して検証
- 避けるべき: 曖昧なタスク、同一ファイルの競合、独立性を破壊するストーリー間依存
- Architectury特有の注意: commonモジュールで80%のロジックを実装、ローダー固有実装は20%に抑制
- エンティティレンダリング: Fabricは標準API、NeoForgeは手動イベント登録 (Issue #641対応)

### Biome System Improvements

**Purpose**: バイオーム境界の視覚的品質向上（将来の改善課題）

- [ ] T307 [Research] Investigate snowy biome boundary smoothing solutions
  - **Issue**: Snowy biome boundaries with other biomes (especially dark_forest) are too sharp/linear
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Biome source temperature ranges meet exactly at -0.2 without overlap
    - `freeze_top_layer` feature depends on biome temperature, causing linear boundaries
  - **Attempted Solutions** (2025-12-19):
    1. Placement modifiers (`in_square`) → Chunk access error
    2. Biome temperature adjustment (0.0 → 0.10) → Limited effect
    3. Offset adjustment (0.0 → 0.3) → Minimal expected effect
  - **Recommended Solutions** (in priority order):
    1. Add transition biomes (Snowy Plains, Snowy Forest, etc.) with intermediate temperatures
    2. Implement custom noise settings for more complex biome distribution
    3. Implement custom snow placement Feature with noise-based logic (last resort)
  - **Reference**: specs/chrono-dawn-mod/research.md → "Snowy Biome Boundary Smoothing (2025-12-19)"
  - **Dependencies**: None (future enhancement)
  - **Priority**: Low (cosmetic improvement)
