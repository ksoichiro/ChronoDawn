## Getting Started

### Step 1: Find Ancient Ruins

Ancient Ruins generate naturally in the **Overworld**. These structures contain:

- First clues about Chrono Dawn dimension

**How to find Ancient Ruins**:
- Explore the Overworld surface in various biomes

- Use `/locate structure chronodawn:ancient_ruins` (if cheats enabled)

**Tip**: Ancient Ruins are surface structures that spawn in various biomes. Keep exploring the landscape until you find one!

### Step 2: Unlock the Time Hourglass Recipe

1. Open chests in Ancient Ruins
2. Find the **"Time Hourglass Blueprint"** (Knowledge Book)
3. Right-click the blueprint to unlock the recipe

### Step 3: Gather Materials and Build

3. Gather other materials needed (check your Recipe Book)
4. Craft **Time Hourglass** and **Clockstone Blocks** for the portal frame
5. Build a portal frame (minimum 4×5, same as Nether portals)

**Tip**: Minimum portal needs at least 90 Clockstone (10 Clockstone Blocks × 9 Clockstone each)

**Important**: The Time Hourglass is consumed on use, so craft extras for multiple portals!

   - Each mid-boss can only be fought once!
   - Plan your route to find all 4 structures

4. **Time Tyrant Strategy**
   - **Without Chrono Aegis**: Very difficult, bring lots of healing
   - **With Chrono Aegis**: Much more manageable
   - Phase 2 (66%-33% HP) and Phase 3 (below 33% HP) are harder - save resources
   - Dodge Stasis Wave (very high damage)

### Resource Farming

1. **Clockstone**
   - Mine in Ancient Ruins (Overworld)
   - Limited supply per structure
   - Explore multiple Ancient Ruins if needed
   - Also found underground in Chrono Dawn

2. **Enhanced Clockstone**
   - Desert Clock Tower loot chests
   - Time Guardian boss drops
   - Required for Portal Stabilizer
   - Limited quantity - use wisely

3. **Time Crystal**
   - Mine Time Crystal Ore in Chrono Dawn
   - Used for advanced recipes
   - Renewable resource (ore respawns)

4. **Wood Resources**
   - All three wood types (Time, Dark Time, Ancient Time Wood) are abundant
   - Saplings allow renewable tree farms
   - Use for building and crafting
   - Each wood type has unique appearance

### Food Production

1. **Fruit of Time**
   - Harvest from Fruit of Time blocks
   - Grants Haste (useful for building)
   - Good food value

2. **Time Wheat Farms**
   - Plant Time Wheat Seeds
   - Automate with water and collection system
   - Produces Time Bread, cookies, etc.

3. **Chrono Melon Farms**
   - Plant Chrono Melon Seeds
   - Grows like vanilla melons
   - Provides good hunger restoration

4. **Temporal Root**
   - Found naturally in Chrono Dawn
   - Bake for better food value
   - Make stew for variety

### Advanced Tips

1. **Respawn Mechanics**
   - You can set respawn point with beds or respawn anchors in Chrono Dawn
   - Beds work safely (unlike Nether/End where they explode)
   - If no respawn point is set, you respawn in Overworld
   - Portal Stabilizer does **NOT** affect respawn location
   - You can always escape by breaking bed and dying (last resort!)

2. **Time Distortion Stacking**
   - Mobs already have Slowness IV in Chrono Dawn
   - You can apply additional slowness with Chrono Aegis (when blocking)
   - Makes combat trivially easy!

3. **Ultimate Gear Set**
   - Combine all artifacts for maximum power:
     - Chronoblade (weapon)
     - Time Tyrant Mail (chest)
     - Echoing Time Boots (feet)
     - Chrono Aegis (offhand)
     - Unstable Pocket Watch (inventory)

4. **Decorative Building**
   - Three wood types provide variety
   - Clockwork Blocks for mechanical themes
   - Time Crystal Blocks for lighting
   - Temporal Bricks for ancient aesthetics

## Troubleshooting

### Portal Issues

**Portal won't activate**:
- Check frame size (4×5 minimum, 23×23 maximum, corners optional)
- Ensure all frame blocks are Clockstone Blocks (not other blocks)
- Verify you're using Time Hourglass (right-click on frame)
- Frame must be hollow inside (no blocks in center)

**Can't return to Overworld**:
- Find Forgotten Library for Portal Stabilizer recipe
- Craft Portal Stabilizer using Enhanced Clockstone from Desert Clock Tower
- Right-click portal frame with Portal Stabilizer
- Re-ignite portal with Time Hourglass after stabilization

**Portal disappeared after entry**:
- This is normal - portal becomes one-way
- Follow progression path to find Portal Stabilizer
- Alternative emergency escape: break bed and die (lose items)

### Combat Issues

**Mobs not slowed**:
- Time Distortion only affects hostile mobs, not passive animals
- Some hostile mobs are immune to Slowness effects
- Effect is applied automatically - no action needed
- If issue persists, check mod installation

**Boss won't spawn**:
- **Temporal Phantom**: Navigate maze and enter the boss room
- **Entropy Keeper**: Activate specific trapdoor in Entropy Crypt
- **Time Guardian**: Reach 5th floor of Desert Clock Tower
- **Time Tyrant**: Use Master Clock Key at Master Clock entrance

**Boss too difficult**:
- Upgrade armor and weapons
- Bring more healing items (Golden Apples, potions)
- For Time Tyrant: Craft Chrono Aegis first (makes fight much easier)

### Exploration Issues

**Can't find structures**:
- Keep exploring different biomes
- Use `/locate structure chronodawn:[structure_name]` (if cheats enabled)
- Structures: `ancient_ruins`, `forgotten_library`, `desert_clock_tower`, `guardian_vault`, `clockwork_depths`, `phantom_catacombs`, `entropy_crypt`, `master_clock`

**Lost in Phantom Catacombs**:
- Use torches or blocks to mark paths (place on right wall, follow back)
- Systematically explore the maze to find the boss room
- Create map in F3 menu notes

### Item Issues

**Lost Master Clock Key**:
- Find another Desert Clock Tower - multiple spawn per world
- Defeat Time Guardian again to obtain another key
- Store important items safely in chests to avoid searching again

**Not enough Enhanced Clockstone**:
- Explore all floors of Desert Clock Tower
- Defeat Time Guardian for additional drops
- Check all loot chests thoroughly

## FAQ

### Q: Can I return to the Overworld after entering Chrono Dawn?

**A**: Not immediately. The portal becomes one-way after entry. You must:
1. Find the Forgotten Library
2. Craft the Portal Stabilizer
3. Stabilize your portal to enable bidirectional travel

### Q: What happens if I die in Chrono Dawn?

**A**: You respawn at your bed/respawn anchor (if set), or at world spawn if none set. The portal does NOT affect respawn location. If you haven't stabilized the portal, you may need to rebuild it to return to Chrono Dawn.

### Q: Can I fight bosses multiple times?

**A**: No. Each boss spawns only once per world. Plan your fights carefully and ensure you collect all drops!

### Q: Do I need to defeat all mid-bosses?

**A**: Not required, but **highly recommended**. The Chrono Aegis (crafted from 4 mid-boss drops) makes the Time Tyrant fight much easier. Fighting Time Tyrant without Chrono Aegis is extremely challenging!

### Q: What's the best order to fight bosses?

**A**:
1. **Time Guardian** (Desert Clock Tower) - for Master Clock Key and Enhanced Clockstone
2. **All 4 mid-bosses** (any order) - for Chrono Aegis materials
   - Chronos Warden
   - Clockwork Colossus
   - Temporal Phantom
   - Entropy Keeper
3. **Time Tyrant** (Master Clock) - final boss (use Chrono Aegis!)

### Q: Can I bring items from Chrono Dawn back to the Overworld?

**A**: Yes! After stabilizing the portal with the Portal Stabilizer, you can freely travel between dimensions with items.

### Q: What if I lose my Master Clock Key?

**A**: You can find another Desert Clock Tower and defeat another Time Guardian to obtain a new key. Multiple Desert Clock Towers spawn in Chrono Dawn, so you're not locked out permanently. Store important items safely to avoid the hassle of searching again!

### Q: Are there any renewable resources?

**A**: Yes!
- **Renewable**: All three wood types (via saplings), Time Wheat, Chrono Melons, Time Crystals, Reversing Time Sandstone, mushrooms, crops
- **Non-renewable** (limited per world): Clockstone (Ancient Ruins), Enhanced Clockstone (Desert Clock Tower + Time Guardian), boss drops

### Q: Can I create multiple portals?

**A**: Yes! After stabilizing the dimension, you can create multiple portals. Each portal needs:
- Clockstone Block frame (4×5 minimum)
- Time Hourglass to activate
- All portals link between Overworld and Chrono Dawn (not to each other)

### Q: What's the difference between the three wood types?

**A**: Only appearance/aesthetics. All three wood types (Time Wood, Dark Time Wood, Ancient Time Wood) have the same properties and full block sets. Use them for building variety and decoration.

### Q: How do I get the in-game guide book?

**A**: You'll receive the "Chronicle of Chrono Dawn" guide book automatically when entering the Chrono Dawn dimension. Use this guide to learn about progression, structures, bosses, and items in the frozen world.
