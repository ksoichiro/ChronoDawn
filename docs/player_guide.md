## Getting Started

### Phase 1: Finding the Ancient Ruins

When you spawn in a new world, your first goal is to find **Ancient Ruins** structures in the Overworld. These ruins contain crucial items:

- **Clockstone Ore**: Mine this ore to obtain Clockstone, the basic material for crafting
- **Time Hourglass Recipe**: Found in chests within the ruins
- **Portal Frame Blocks**: Pre-built portal frames may be present

**How to find Ancient Ruins**:
- Explore caves, underground areas, and surface structures
- Use `/locate structure chronosphere:ancient_ruins` (creative/cheats enabled)

### Phase 2: Crafting the Time Hourglass

Once you have Clockstone, craft the **Time Hourglass**:

```
Recipe (shapeless):
- 4x Clockstone
- 1x Glass Bottle
- 1x Sand
```

**Important**: The Time Hourglass is consumed on use, so craft extras for multiple portals!

### Phase 3: Building the Portal

Build a portal frame using **Clockstone Blocks**:

- Minimum size: 4 blocks wide × 5 blocks tall (like Nether portal)
- Maximum size: 23×23 blocks
- Frame must be a complete rectangle

**Crafting Clockstone Block**:
```
Recipe (shapeless):
- 4x Clockstone
```

### Phase 4: Entering the Chronosphere

1. Right-click the portal frame with the **Time Hourglass**
2. The portal activates with an orange/gold glow
3. Walk through to enter the Chronosphere dimension

**⚠️ WARNING**: After you enter, the portal will deactivate! You cannot return until you find a way to stabilize it.

## Exploring the Chronosphere

### Dimension Features

#### Time Distortion Effect
- All hostile mobs in the Chronosphere move **extremely slowly** (Slowness IV)
- You move at normal speed, giving you a major advantage
- Use this to your advantage when exploring dangerous areas

#### Biomes

The Chronosphere has 8 unique biomes with distinct characteristics:

1. **Chronosphere Forest**: Dense Time Wood trees, moderate difficulty
2. **Chronosphere Desert**: Sandy terrain with Desert Clock Tower structures
3. **Chronosphere Mountain**: High elevation, rocky terrain
4. **Chronosphere Ocean**: Water-filled areas with unique marine features
5. **Chronosphere Snowy**: Frozen landscape with snow and ice
6. **Chronosphere Swamp**: Murky waters and unusual vegetation
7. **Chronosphere Dark Forest**: Dense, shadowy woods with higher mob spawn rates
8. **Chronosphere Ancient Forest**: Ancient Time Wood trees, rare structures

#### Time Wood Trees

Harvest **Time Wood** logs and saplings to use in construction:

- **Time Wood Log**: Yellow-olive wood with unique texture
- **Time Wood Planks**: Craft from logs
- **Time Wood Stairs, Slabs, Fences**: Full block set available
- **Time Wood Door and Trapdoor**: Functional entry/exit points
- **Time Wood Sapling**: Plant to grow new trees

### Phase 5: Finding the Forgotten Library

Your primary objective in the Chronosphere is to find the **Forgotten Library** structure. This structure contains:

- **Portal Stabilizer Recipe**: Essential for returning to the Overworld
- **Loot Chests**: Rare materials and books

**How to find the Forgotten Library**:
- Explore the Chronosphere dimension
- Look for distinctive ancient architecture
- Use `/locate structure chronosphere:forgotten_library` (creative/cheats enabled)

### Phase 6: Crafting the Portal Stabilizer

Once you have the recipe, gather materials and craft the **Portal Stabilizer**:

```
Recipe:
- 4x Enhanced Clockstone (found in Desert Clock Tower)
- 2x Ender Pearl
- 1x Diamond
- 1x Clockstone Block
```

**Note**: You'll need to explore the **Desert Clock Tower** structure to obtain Enhanced Clockstone.

### Phase 7: Stabilizing the Portal

1. Return to your original portal location in the Chronosphere
2. Right-click the portal frame with the **Portal Stabilizer**
3. The dimension stabilizes with a spectacular particle effect and message
4. The portal is now **bidirectional** - you can freely travel between dimensions

**Important**: After stabilization, you must use a **Time Hourglass** to re-ignite the portal. The Portal Stabilizer only stabilizes the dimension, it does NOT ignite portals.

## Tips and Tricks

4. **Food Supply**: Harvest Fruits of Time for sustainable food source
