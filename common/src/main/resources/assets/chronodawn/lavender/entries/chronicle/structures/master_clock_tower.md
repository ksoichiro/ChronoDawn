The heart of this frozen world.

**Entry Requirement:**
3 Ancient Gears are required to open the boss chamber.

Defeating [Clockwork Sentinels](^chronodawn:bosses/clockwork_sentinel) may yield these gears.

Inside awaits the [Time Tyrant](^chronodawn:bosses/time_tyrant), the final guardian of the Stasis Core.
